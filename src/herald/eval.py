"""Phase 1 eval harness — run the 10 Anti-Rent validation questions.

Per PLAN §12, Phase 1 isn't done until the CLI produces well-cited,
factually defensible answers to all 10 questions. This module bundles
them and provides ``run_eval()`` + a Markdown report formatter for
hand-grading.

The questions are hardcoded (not in a data file) so the eval-harness
contract lives in version control alongside the code that consumes it.
If we ever change the question set, that's a real-and-versioned change.
