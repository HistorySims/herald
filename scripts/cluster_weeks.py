"""Populate cluster_weeks: per-cluster per-week aggregates for the
Cluster Dossier page.

For every (tier, label) cluster in the active run, bins its
status='active' AND content_type=0 member chunks by ISO week and
computes per week:

  chunk_count       — members that week
  count_by_paper    — {lccn: count}
  mean_ocr_quality  — mean quality_score of scored members (null if none)
  centroid_x/_y     — mean of members' stored UMAP coords
                      (mean-of-projections, deliberately — no UMAP
                      model persistence, visually consistent with the
                      explore map)
  top_terms         — top ~5 c-TF-IDF terms for the week, computed
                      WITHIN the cluster: this week's chunks vs the
                      cluster's other weeks. Pure term math, no LLM.

Idempotent — deletes and rewrites all rows for the active run's
clusters. Run after cluster_recompute.py.

Usage:
    uv run scripts/cluster_weeks.py
